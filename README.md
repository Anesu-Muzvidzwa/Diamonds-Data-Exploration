# Diamonds Data Exploration
 The aim of the project was to investigate the the characteristics of diamonds that could be used to predict their prices. This exploration was centred arounf the four C's of diamonds: Carat(weight), cut grade, and clarity grade.
The data consisted of prices and attributes of approximately 54,000 round-cut diamonds. The attributes included the four Cs of diamonds, as well as additional measurements such as table, depth, and dimensions. Thirty-nine data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies or missing information.
